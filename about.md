Dear readers,

My name is Gershom James, and I’m a 21-year-old guy who loves everything tech and, as some of my acquaintances might tell you, an all-around "nerd." I’m passionate about cybersecurity, networking, artificial intelligence, digital forensics, and fascinated with anything and everything tech-related. I especially love the human mind and the wonderful way that it adapts, learns and grows as time moves on. Knowledge is power and that is why I will attempt to share as much knowledge as I can so that at the end of the day, we are all smarter! As for what I do away from my desk and computer, I enjoy ice hockey, swimming, going on hikes, and visiting new places.

I’m a Bible-believing Christian, and I strive to make decisions guided by biblical principles and aim to live with integrity, kindness, love, and true purpose.

I would love for you to visit this blog and get some inspiration and perspectives from everything spoken here. I strongly believe that we need more thinkers and tinkerers in this world.

Warm regards,
Gershom James

P.S. - I would like to thank and credit my friend [Jacob](https://github.com/jacobzymet), who inspired me to start this up to help share my thoughts and ideas with the world.
