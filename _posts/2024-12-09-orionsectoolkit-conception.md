I hope you have been having a wonderful day so far today. It is currently going to be 2 am and I finally put my idea to have a cyber security toolkit into action(beginning stages).

I have been having an idea for the past many weeks to  create a tool that would not only help me but help other people that might want a simple toolkit that is also comprehensive enough for them to automate and simplify cybersec tasks on a day-to-day basis.

I had a huge dilemma on what I would name this tool. I wanted a name and naming convention that made sense and finally settled on Orion as the base name. As you can tell the tool names aren't that great at the moment but they properly reflect what each tool will be accomplishing. I think that this will help me to not lose focus on what the actual tool is supposed to be during development.

As of the writing of this post, I publicly admit that my knowledge in cyber security is very limited and will be improved only as time passes. I happen to know that automation plays a huge role in "red teaming" which is a skill set that I am currently interested in learning and improving on as well.

I would like for these tools help whoever needs an easier way to get tedious tasks done so that they can focus more on tasks that are less time consuming. I believe that time isn't money but that creativity is money, the reason being that time is limited, but creativity is unlimited, which is why I aim to create tools that save time, so everyone can focus on being creative and using their beautifully wonderful and complex brains.

I will try to document struggles that I face during the development phase of this project as a whole, and the development of the individual tools contained within these tools, and hopefully I have the time to share the information that I learned along the way!

Au revoir :)
