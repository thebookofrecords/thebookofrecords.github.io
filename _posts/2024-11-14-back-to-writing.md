Hello again!  

I guess that I am back to writing now, and it is now a little past 7 PM. I will be attempting to write more as I get thoughts, ideas, and inspirations. I have many goals, ideas, and passions that I want to pursue in life, and despite my uncertainty on how I will accomplish them, I am determined to get them done.  

My idea with what I want to do with this blog/site is that I want to write down the different things that I am thinking about, not just for me to look back and see what I used to think about, but even more to share knowledge and grow. I also would like to learn how to be more concise in my speaking and writing, and since practice makes perfect, I am certainly motivated to get that wish taken care of.  

This entry today is not to convey any specific idea but just another more "current" intro to this blog. I am well aware that I need not be making many intros, but I guess this is just my way of getting warmed up to the idea of writing.  

I hope to get better at my grammar, conciseness (if that is even a word), and the way my brain puts conceptual ideas together. I also think that writing will help me with research, as I would like to not put out obnoxious or silly content but rather my thoughts along with whatever research that I do. When I say "research," I am merely referring to (at the moment at least, because I am sure that it will get better) a quick Google or DuckDuckGo search on whatever related topic, or a drive down memory lane to reflect on past experiences.  

I want to add a dark theme button to this website, but since I am using a template, I am not entirely sure about how I am going to incorporate that. It would be interesting and pretty cool to be able to add that functionality to this site.  

I was thinking about a nice way for you, my wonderful smart and intelligent readers, to contact me, and I think that the best way would be to DM me on Twitter @gershom_james, which is my handle.

I can't believe that it is now nearly 8 PM. That is insane. I will have to speed up this writing. I mainly took a de-tour due to the fact that my Matrix account was not verifying and it is annoying because I forgot my password! Gotta love life.

Au revoir :)
