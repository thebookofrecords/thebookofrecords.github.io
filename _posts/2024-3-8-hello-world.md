Hello World!

I am a bit new to writing anything online, so I think I will introduce myself.

My name is Gershom, and I am currently studying for my CompTIA A+ certification. I have an aspiration to enter the cybersecurity field and eventually become a cybersecurity professional. I have always had an interest in computers and technology since I was a child. I am decently familiar with the Windows and Linux operating systems and have yet to properly use Mac/OSX.

I would also love any and all support/mentoring that I can get, so please contact me for anything. I hope that I can properly, appropriately, and actively record whatever I am learning and hopefully help others as they pursue their journey in technology.

Au revoir :)
