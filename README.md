# About Me

Dear readers,

My name is **Gershom James**, and I’m a 21-year-old guy who loves everything tech and, as some of my acquaintances might tell you, an all-around "nerd." I’m passionate about **cybersecurity**, **networking**, **artificial intelligence**, **digital forensics**, and fascinated with anything and everything tech-related. I enjoy **ice hockey**, **swimming**, going on **hikes**, and visiting new places.

I’m a **Bible-believing Christian**, and I strive to make decisions guided by biblical principles and aim to live with integrity, kindness, love, and true purpose.

I would love for you to visit this blog and get some inspiration and perspectives from everything spoken here. I strongly believe that we need more thinkers and tinkerers in this world.

Warm regards,  
Gershom James

P.S. - I would like to thank and credit my friend [Jacob](https://github.com/jacobzymet), who inspired me to start this up to help share my thoughts and ideas with the world.
